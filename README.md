## **Inspiration**
I tend to use a few shortcuts (namely Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v, Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z) a lot, especially for programming and designing, and I use esc and jump a lot for playing video games. The problem is that it is less efficient than having a dedicated key for these actions.

## **Challenges**
This was my first time ever using KiCad, and ever designing a PCB! Before this I had only ever used bread boards or protoboards and learning to make PCBs was the main hurdle.

## **Specifications**

### BOM:
* 6x Cherry MX Switches
* 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
* 1x XIAO RP2040
* 4x Blank DSA Keycaps
* 4x M3x16 Bolt
* 4x M3 Heatset

### Others:
* KMK Firmware
* Top Case.stl
* Bottom Case.stl
